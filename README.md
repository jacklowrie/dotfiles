# Jack's dotfiles
All my config files. Turns out version controlling them saves headaches too.

## Command Prompt
In general, I use [starship](https://starship.rs/) where I can. It isn't
installed on Tuft's Homework servers, so I had to make a custom prompt for
that server. It isn't perfect, but it's close enough and lightyears better
than the default prompt.

## Halligan
I asked to have my shell changed to bash. Zsh is strongly discouraged,
otherwise I'd have switched to that for consistency. Switching to bash is
simple, all you need to do is email IT and ask (with your user name). 

## Local
Not a whole lot to show for my local. I use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) for
software/package management, zsh as my shell, and [ZimFW](https://zimfw.sh/)
with all the behavior modules and about half of the general productivity
modules turned on to manage shell configuration. Could I manage that directly
without zim? Probably, but I'm lazy and it's portable. It's also 
lighter-weight than OhMyZSH, so Zim's a happy compromise.

In all honesty, after spending all that time setting up halligan, I think I
understand bash better than zsh. Might be worth switching to bash
everywhere...
